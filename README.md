## Setup
There are few requirements that must be met:

* Android device runs on Android 8.1 (Oreo) or later
* Internet Access

### Github

One way to use the app is through this github repository. First, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ijemmao/dartmouth-naps.git
```

Open project in Android Studio, then clean and rebuild the project
```
Build > Clean Project
Build > Rebuild Project
```

Then Press the Play button to run the app!ðŸŽ‰

### APKs

Another way to use the app is to download one of these APKs. The only difference between the two of them is the preset period for the review prompt `Notification`. One of them has a period of 1 min, meaning after 1 min of the application still being active (potentially pushed to the back, but the location monitor `Notification` keeps it considered active), but with the `CampusMapFragment` not active, the review prompt `Notification` will be posted. With this occurring after 1 min, it can sometimes pop up if the user is in other `Activity`s for long enough, which seems odd, but this wouldn't occur with a more realistic time period of 30 min, 1 hr, or 2 hr. Do display this, our second APK is a 15-min version, which more accurately reflects the UX of the review prompt `Notification`, but in a mediary timespan that isn't too short nor too long.

* [1-min APK](https://github.com/ijemmao/dartmouth-naps/raw/master/DartmouthNaps_1m_5s.apk)
* [15-min APK](https://github.com/ijemmao/dartmouth-naps/blob/master/DartmouthNaps_15m_2m.apk)

## System Designs

### Client Side

#### Activities

##### Main Activity

##### Login and Sign up Activities

##### New Review and Review Activities
These `Activity`s are fairly similar in visual appearance; however, they have different functionality and purpose for the overall user experience.

The `NewReviewActivity` allows the user to create a new review by providing an image of their location, a short title, and a rating between 1-5 for the noise, comfort, and light quality. Users are unable to upload their review if they fail to provide any of details.

This activity makes use of the `RatingFragment`.

The `ReviewActivity` show cases all the data the review with the addition of convenience, which is calculated based on the user's location.

This activity makes use of the `RatingFragment` but disabling the buttons that are within the fragment.

#### Fragments

##### Map Fragment
The bottom 40% of the screen is occupied by the `ReviewCardContainerFragment`, with a `SupportMapFragment` in the background displaying campus. This `SupportMapFragment` has been stylized through adjustments made on a JSON string from the [Google Maps Platform Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/). `Review`s are marked on the map with the [bed marker](https://github.com/ijemmao/dartmouth-naps/blob/master/DartmouthNaps/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_marker_bed.xml), and the user's current `Location` is marked on the map with the [sheos marker](https://github.com/ijemmao/dartmouth-naps/blob/master/DartmouthNaps/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_marker_shoes.xml). When the user taps on one of the pins, the map centers on that pin, and if it was a `Review` pin, the `ReviewCardContainerFragment` sets the corresponding `ReviewCardFragment` to be active.

##### Review Card Fragment
Each Review object is represented with a Review Card Fragment that is overlaid on the `CampusMapFragment`.

##### Review Card Container Fragment
This fragment contains all the `ReviewCardFragment`s which allows for swiping functionality. On swiping, the `SupportMapFragment` centers on the associated `Review`.

##### Rating Fragment
The Noise, Comfort, and Light ratings all implement the Rating fragment which makes for keeping track of the unique statuses for each Review fairly simple.

##### Starred Location Fragment

##### My Reviews Fragment
The user has the ability to see all of their active reviews. On this view, they only have the option to delete their reviews.

#### Async Logic

##### Location Tracking Service

##### Image Loading Thread
Firebase for Android doesn't provide the capability to complete multiple async tasks at the same time (similar to Javascript's `Promise` class). Because of this limitation, Java's `Future` class was used to synchronously complete async tasks.

Completing multiple `Future` tasks is computationally heavy on the main UI thread. Therefore, this logic was moved out to an AsyncTask named `ImageLoadTask`, which is called every time there is a change in the database so the user see the most up-to-date list of reviews.

### Controller

#### Firebase Data Source

#### Notification Center

### Models

#### LatLng

##### Variables

```Java
double latitude
double longitude
```

##### Functions

```Java
// There are typical getter and setter functions

public Google.LatLng toGoogleLatLng() {
  // Returns a Google LatLng from original LatLng
}

public Location toLocation() {
  // Returns a Location from original LatLng
}
```


#### Review
This is class that includes all information related to review objects

##### Variables
```Java
String author    // Fireabse uid of the user
int noise        // Rating of the noise quality
int comfort      // Rating of the comfort quality
int light        // Rating of the light quality
int convenience  // Rating of the convenience of review
String title     // Title of the review
String imageName // Name of the review's image
byte[] image     // Data of image
String timestamp // Time when review was created
```

##### Functions
```Java
// There are typical getter and setter functions

public String getFormattedTimestamp() {
  // Returns a formatted time stamp for users
}

public static String getTimeStampFromCalendar(Calendar timestampCal) {
  // Returns the time when review was created
}

public Map<String, Object> toMap() {
  // Returns a Map representation of Review
}
```

### Database Structure

## Technology

* [Android](https://developer.android.com/docs) - Pure Java was used to develop the application. This application supports API levels 27 and higher (Android 8.1 - Oreo).
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) - Stored review and user information.

We would like to thank Professor Xing-Dong Yang and Varun Mishra GR for their support and guidance through creating this application.
